# Nihon ALT
### version three

Originally first build in 2016 as a static, multi-page website using nothing but HTML and CSS, my Nihon ALT project has now reached version three. I've kept the first and second version around for historical purposes, to see how far I've come in my understanding and implementation of web technologies and frameworks like React and Redux. This version implements Node, Express, and MongoDB to complete the ecosystem  for the app.

The idea: Assistant English/Language Teachers (ALTs) in Japan usually do not have materials given to them to teach. Instead, teachers have to design and create their materials, from worksheets, to activities, games, flashcards, etc. My department at iTTTi Japan allowed me to create a website to see the usefulness of collecting our materials and putting them in an easy to navigate online website. I drew inspiration from other websites with similar ideas, but wanted to improve on their way of doing things. The overall goal was to create a user friendly website that required few clicks to reach a given destination. The future goal was to make the website code DRY by using JavaScript and mapping, but I didn't know how to do that at the time. I implemented that in Nihon ALT v1. I also wanted to allow users to upload their own files through forms. I also lacked that knowledge, but this version should solve that and user authentication.
